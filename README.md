## 🤖 A Note on AI

I use ChatGPT as a pair programmer, design collaborator, and creative sounding board. Every project here was built by me — structured, styled, and coded line-by-line — with ChatGPT helping accelerate the process, spot bugs, or offer suggestions.

This collaboration lets me focus on what matters most: **building functional, thoughtful, and human-centered tools.**
